The core concepts of javascript, scope and closures, with a heavy emphasis on understanding this (binding) and object prototypes

I've compiled together all of my notes as I've gone through learning Javascript thus far.
In the future I will clean this up, "index" and categorize my examples by topic.
So far I have a good amount of material in here about this bindings, object prototypes. Need to add some more material
on scope and closures however.
